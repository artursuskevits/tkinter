What is programming?-is the process of creating software or applications using programming languages such as Java Python and other.
What is a variable in programming?-is a storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value that can change during the program's execution.
What is a function in programming?-is a block of code that performs a specific task, can be called from different parts of the program, and may take input parameters and return values.
What is a loop in programming-is a control flow statement that allows a program to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
What is a conditional statement in programming-is a control flow statement that performs different actions depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.
What is an algorithm in programming-is a set of instructions that a program follows to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task.
What is debugging in programming-is the process of finding and fixing errors or defects in a program.
What is an IDE in programming-is a software application that provides tools and features to help developers write and debug code.
What is version control in programming-is the management of changes to a set of files over time, typically used in software development to track changes to source code.
What is a data structure in programming-s a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory, such as arrays, lists, or trees.
What is object oriented programming- is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and manipulate data.
What is a class in programming-is a blueprint for creating objects that define the attributes and behaviors of the object.
What is inheritance in programming-is a mechanism in object oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class.
What is polymorphism in programming-is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same type, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
What is encapsulation in programming-is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for accessing and modifying its state.
What is a compiler in programming-is a program that translates source code into machine code that can be executed by a computer.
What is an interpreter in programming-is a program that executes source code directly without compiling it into machine code first.
What is a database in programming-is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated through software applications.
What is a web server in programming-is a program that listens for incoming requests from clients over the internet and serves web pages or other content in response.
